# Catalog of Onboarding Mechanisms for IoT Devices

When considering each of these technologies, provide one or two sentences on what problem each sets out to solve, a few sentences on how it solves that problem, and then talk about constraints.  Keep in mind our goal for seeking common architectural components.  Some leading questions to help:

 * How does device introduce itself to the infrastructure or peer?
 * What, if any, proof of possession mechanism is there?
 * Is access to other IP-based devices required in order to fully onboard the device?
 * What form of credential is installed on the device?
 * Is full Internet access required for onboarding?
 * Who becomes the root of trust at the end of onboarding (if any)
 * Could/Is the resulting credential be used for application identity?
 * What happens if the box gets reset?
 * How can transfer of ownership occur?
 * How can transfer to a different cloud service (if applicable) occur?
 * What sort of manufacturing requirements are there?
 * What sort of crypto requirements are there?
 * Reference link

Feel free to add or vary the questions.
